> **Data Scientist**: Why is my cutting edge model still not in production?
>
Scenario 1:
> **IT Team**: We are still implementing the scoring engine in Go/Java/C++.   

Scenario 2:
> **IT Team**: We are still figuring out how to read the model.pkl file you provided.

and the push to production pang continues ..

# New Features!

  - `titus2` home page and documentation has been migrated to [https://realworldpython.github.io](https://realworldpython.github.io/titus2/).

Titus 2 - Portable Format for Analytics (PFA) implementation for Python 3.4-3.9 
========

Titus 2 is a fork of the original Titus python library which resides in the (now defunct) [Hadrian repository](https://github.com/opendatagroup/hadrian). Titus is not actively maintained by the Open Data Group and only supports Python 2, so this fork was created to actively support its development for Python 3.

Titus 2 is a complete, independent implementation of [Portable Format for Analytics (PFA)](https://realworldpython.guide/titus2/pfa/) in pure Python. PFA is a specification for scoring/inference engines: event-based processors that perform predictive or analytic calculations. It is a model interchange format which helps smoothen the transition from statistical model development to large-scale and/or online production. `titus2` also focuses on model development, so it includes model producers and PFA manipulation tools in addition to runtime execution (scoring) engine.

### Requirements

Titus 2 uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* `avro-python3 >= 1.8.2`
* `numpy == 1.14.0` (python 3.4 & 3.5) or `numpy >=1.15.0, <1.20` (python 3.6+)
* `pytz >= 2019.1`
* `pyyaml >= 5.1.2`
* `ply >= 3.11`

The above packages are available via `pip` and are automatically installed during setup.

### Installation

Titus requires [Python 3.4+](https://www.python.org/download/) to run.
It can be installed via pip/pip3 as follows:
```sh
$ pip install titus2
```

or you can directly install the latest build from github repository via 
```sh
$ pip install git+https://github.com/animator/titus2.git
```

After installation please run the following elementary example in python

```python
from titus.genpy import PFAEngine

pfa = {"input": "double",
 "output": "double",
 "action": [
   {"+": ["input", 100]}
 ]}
engine, = PFAEngine.fromJson(pfa)

l = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]

for num in l:
    print(num, engine.action(num))
```

### User Guide and Tutorials

See the [Project Documentation](https://realworldpython.github.io/titus2/) for user guide and tutorials.

### Current Testing Framework

To run the tests, you can execute

```
python3 setup.py test
